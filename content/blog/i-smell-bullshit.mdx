[Bullshit is everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPrRxhYJMkQ&t=182s). Politicians and motivational 
speakers have mastered the art. Ads, marketing and PR are its recognized regiment. Even, journalism has changed 
these days. When you read (daily paper) news, online news, are you reading facts or propaganda? Mediocrity and 
venality are seemingly infecting it. Social network floods with ton loads of shit posts and clickjacks; news 
portal full of sponsored news. Reality is becoming opaque concept as bullshiting is plaguing every aspect of 
life.

A few months ago, I read horoscope. It said, "Not knowing what to do is not always a problem - sometimes 
it's just a state of being." Its attempt to convince me immensely succeed. One can easily be moved by these 
statements. It just echoed the reason I read the horoscope in the first place. Talented fortune telling and 
cold psychic reading people have a large group of followers. Only sceptical mind measures the odds. But, when 
our older generation opts to believe these and I can't tell them not to do. Bullshit is what you choose it 
to be.

What makes bullshit bullshit is an unnecessary or unjustified use of language in a particular case which may 
not be well understood outside that context. I may carry pseudo-science and metaphysics and witch hunt of over 
academics. An empty vessel makes the most noise. Wanting desperately to sound like smart, they meander and 
babble tons of jargon. Here is a ['new age bullshit generator'](https://github.com/sebpearce/bullshit) that 
generates pseudo-profound statements based on tweets of a motivational speaker and author.

Yet why we can't cancel the noise, what is stopping from dismissing the bullshit? There is a common 
manifestation of the inability to measure it. 
[What 'the curtains are blue' referencing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments28l5vhwhat_is_the_curtains_are_blue_referencing/). 
There is no wrong answer to a subjective and abstract argument. It increases in opportunities and obligation 
for people to speak their mind, even it lacks the strong 'apprehension of reality'. Increased level of 
bullshiting can be profitable. So, rather than too much bullshit, measured and methodical bullshiting 
can increase one's payout. I am amazed at how it a necessary evil for business person and entrepreneurs, 
'fake until you make it'. For them it is a superpower, it is the ability to suspend disbelief. Bullshiting 
is a great way to buy the time and resources for the right idea to show up. Hence, in conclusion, bullshiting 
can be post-realization of the truth, for the truth-seekers. To exploit the change one should not be afraid to 
cross the valley of adaptive bullshit to climb the mountain of truth.
